We start with an introduction to probabilistic coupling. Coupling is a powerful tool which can be used for probabilistic reasoning and proofs. A simple example comparing the frequency of heads between two biased coins will be studied, followed by how coupling can be used to prove the convergence of a positive recurrent Markov chain. Following which, we will give an overview of the Stein-Chen method for establishing Poisson approximations of various random variables. Couplings are used here to give explicit bounds for the total variation distance between the random variable and its Poisson approximation. A `classic' occupancy problem will be studied, and the construction of an appropriate coupling will be used to justify a Poisson approximation here.
